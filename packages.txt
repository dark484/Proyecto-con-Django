This small document explains which packages are currently available and how to install/upgrade.

Django 1.4(obviously - see README.txt for basic usage)
Setuptools-0.6c11(the latest version as of this release)
pip-1.1(the latest version as of this release)

To upgrade Django as new versions are available:

C> easy_install -U django

To install any python-only package:

C> easy_install django-manifest

Replace "django-manifest" with any python package which doesn't require a C module.

easy_install are added to your PATH when you launch "start.bat"

Packages can also be manually installed via their "setup.py"

C> python setup.py install

Run this inside the extracted package you downloaded.  Most source packages are in Tar.gz format.
To extract a tar.gz using Python, do the following:

C\Downloads> python
>>> import tarfile
>>> tar = tarfile.open("fancypackage-0.5.4.tar.gz")
>>> tar.extractall()
>>> tar.close()
>>> exit()
C\Downloads> cd fancypackage-0.5.4
C\Downloads\fancypackage-0.5.4> python setup.py install

This will work for most packages downloaded from an authors website or github.

I hope to include an untar command in a future release(of course it will be made in Python).
