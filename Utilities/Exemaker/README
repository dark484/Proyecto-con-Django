ExeMaker release 1.2 (October 12, 2004)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The ExeMaker utility takes a Python script, installs it in a given
directory, and creates an EXE file in the same directory.  When you
run the EXE, it locates and loads a suitable Python interpreter DLL,
and runs the script.

Usage:

	> exemaker myscript.py c:/bin
	c:/bin/myscript.exe ok
	c:/bin/myscript.py ok

	> myscript
	welcome to my script!

The ExeMaker is designed to quickly turn small scripts into command
line utilities, so you can use them (and distribute them) without
having to set up PY associations, create BAT files, or fool around
with more sophisticated bundling tools.

For more information on this tool, see:

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Unpack the ZIP archive.

2. Copy the exemaker.py and exemaker.exe files to a suitable directory
   on your path.

3. To check that the toolkit works, run "exemaker" without any arguments.
   You should get output similar to:

	Usage:

	    exemaker [-i interpreter] scriptname [target-dir]

	installs the given script in the target directory.

	...

   If you get an error dialogue, make sure that the DLL or EXE file
   listed on the first first line of exemaker.py can be found on your
   path.  This line usually looks like:

	#!python.exe

   You can add a path, if necessary (but if you do, the Python DLL
   used by the EXE file must be in the same directory, or at least
   be found on the path).  Example:

        #!/python23/python.exe

   You can also point directly to a Python DLL, if you prefer.
   Examples:

        #!python23.dll
        #!/windows/system32/python24.dll
        #!/py21/python21.dll

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes
--------------------------------------------------------------------

(1.2 released)

- Added EXE support.  If you specify a Python executable (with or
  without a path), the loader will inspect that file to figure out
  what DLL to use.  If you specify a path for the executable, the
  loader looks for the DLL in the same directory as the executable,
  before searching along the path.

(1.1 released)

- Don't call Py_SetPythonHome() if there's no Python library
  directory relative to the Python DLL (in this case, Python's
  own GetPath will figure things out all by itself).

(1.0 released)
